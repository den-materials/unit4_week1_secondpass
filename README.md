# Unit 4 Week 1 Second Pass

## Administering Local MAMP / Dreamhost / etc DB

- Open up MAMP and `Start Servers`.
- Select `Open WebStart Page`.
- Click the `MySQL can be administered with phpMyAdmin.` under the "MySQL" heading.
- Start playing.

We will also talk briefly about how PHP can be used to connect to the DB in the next class.

With any good hosting service you get some sort of SSH access which we showed in the [Intro to Ops](https://github.com/den-wdi-2/intro-to-ops) class.  Once you can log in with SSH, you can treat the command line much like you would your own, though some hosting services have limits on what you can install/run and how.

<!--This is more a trial-and-error experience.  You're trying to find the hosting environment that most suits your needs at the cheapest price, and that's something you unfortunately have to figure out on your own, sometimes the hard way. -->

## React Refresh

[This introduction](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learning-react-getting-started-and-concepts) to React covers most of the ground we covered on Tuesday and a little more.  It's well-worded, and is followed up by one of Scoth's (in)famous tutorials.  They are usually well-presented, but I have seen typos and miswritten code in their tutorials before, so go slowly through [this one](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-simple-to-do-app-with-react).

[This list of top React tutorials](http://andrewhfarmer.com/getting-started-tutorials/) will be useful for folks who want to do React for Project 4 or beyond.

If you are looking to move from CodePen to full-stack "from scratch", you should start with the [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit).  Read its documentation carefully and get a feel for the file structure before building.

## Dungeon Crawler

## WordPress

Treehouse has a [WordPress Course](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/wordpress-development) that I have gone through myself.  It covers a lot of good material, but the instructor moves **way too fast** through exercises so I give it a 7/10.

The best way to learn more about WordPress is to sign up to help friends redesign or create their WordPress sites.  You may even get some $$ out of it!
