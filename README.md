# Unit 4 Week 1 Second Pass

## React Materials

If you go to the [den-materials organization](https://github.com/den-materials/) and search for "react" there are a lot of extra topics we did not get time to cover in this class.

[This introduction](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learning-react-getting-started-and-concepts) to React covers most of the ground we covered earlier and a little more.  It's well-worded, and is followed up by one of Scoth's (in)famous tutorials.  They are usually well-presented, but I have seen typos and miswritten code in their tutorials before, so go slowly through [this one](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-simple-to-do-app-with-react).

[This list of top React tutorials](https://www.javascriptstuff.com/react-tutorials/) will be useful for folks who want to do React for Project 4 or beyond.

We also have a lot of material we can share on advanced React topics and React Native if you would like them.

## WordPress

Wordpress is a little bit of the wild west, because anyone can make anything for it.  Youtube some tutorials for some basics, but themes are often times in their own world of functionality (sometimes with bugs). 

The best way to learn more about WordPress is to sign up to help friends redesign or create their WordPress sites.  You may even get some $$ out of it!
